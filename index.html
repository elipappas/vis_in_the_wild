            <h2>Purpose of the Visualization</h2>
            <p>
                The purpose of this visual is to provide easy to interpret and detailed analysis of baseball statistics that are otherwise left simply in a stat box.
                It is meant to be used by baseball fans and analysts to gain insights into the performance of players and teams and is very interactive as you can sort by player,
                by team, and by season. The end goal is to allow users to view advanced and simple statistics easily and allow the user to gain insights on their own and be able to
                compare statistics wholistically.

            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <p>
                This website is owned and update by the MLB themselves so they use their own statistics and data from MLB statcast. The statistics are also updated live as they are happening.
            </p>

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>
                The target audience for this visualization is baseball fans and analysts. The visualization is designed to be easy to use and interpret, allowing users to gain insights into the performance of players and teams.
                I think that the great thing about this site is that it's very friendly both to casual fans as well as stat nerds as it gives simple visualizations like homerun maps while also providing advanced stats most people never
                consider, like barrels, launch angle, and exit velocity.

            <h2>Questions and Insights</h2>
            <p>
                The visualization allows users to answer questions such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Who is the best hitter in the league?</li>
                    <li>Who is the best pitcher in the league?</li>
                    <li>Who is the best fielder in the league?</li>
                    <li>Who is the best baserunner in the league?</li>
                    <li>Who is the best all-around player in the league?</li>
                    <li>How good is a certain player compared to others?</li>
                    <li>Which Ballpark has the most homeruns hit in it?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Users can find these answers by searching specific parts of the site as it is quite extensive in its statistics.</p>
            <p>An example finding is that Aaron Judge is the statistically  best hitter of 2024 when it comes to getting on base and homeruns whith Shohei Ohtani near behind him in homeruns.</p>

            <h2>Design Choices</h2>
            <p>
                The design of this visualization is very simple and easy to use and tries not to overcomplicate itself when you first land on a page. For example,
                when you land on a stats page for a player, you first see a picture of the player, the last 3 years stats, their percentile rankings, and a map of all their hits.
                But, as youu scroll down you get more graphs stat sheets and comparisons that the average user is not interested in. I also really like the color choices for the visualizations
                as they use colors that correlate well such as red for really good on the percentile rankings and separate hits well also.

            <h2>Limitations</h2>
            <p>
                While the site is extensive in its data and is simple for the average user just looking for quick stats, it can be cumbersome to look for very specific stats and can be difficult to navigate
                at times as it has an almost overwhelming amount of data. It also does not have a lot of interactivity for the average user and tends to show stat sheets as a first thought.
